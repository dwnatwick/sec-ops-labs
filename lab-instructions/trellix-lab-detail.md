Below is a comprehensive, step‐by‐step lab that demonstrates how to leverage Microsoft Defender XDR’s advanced hunting and forensic investigation capabilities—integrated with Trellix event data—to investigate and respond to security incidents. In this lab you will:

- Prepare and verify your environments (Microsoft Defender XDR and Trellix).  
- Configure Trellix to forward or export its forensic-related logs into Defender XDR.  
- Use Kusto Query Language (KQL) in Defender XDR to review and correlate Trellix events alongside native data.  
- Build a forensic timeline and document your findings for incident response.

> **Note:**  
> This lab assumes you have an active Microsoft Defender XDR (or Microsoft 365 Defender) subscription and that you are licensed to use Advanced Hunting. You should also have administrative access to the Trellix platform (or its log export mechanism) and the necessary permissions to configure log forwarding/API access. Some steps (for example, setting up log forwarding via Syslog or custom connectors) may vary depending on your deployment.

## **Step 1. Environment Preparation**

### 1.1 Verify Microsoft Defender XDR Setup

- **Access the Portal:**  
  Sign into the [Microsoft 365 Defender Portal](https://security.microsoft.com) with an account that has Advanced Hunting and incident response permissions.

- **Familiarize with Advanced Hunting:**  
  Click on **Advanced Hunting** in the left navigation pane. Review the schema explorer to understand tables (for example, *DeviceProcessEvents*, *DeviceNetworkEvents*, etc.) where native logs are collected.

### 1.2 Verify Trellix Environment

- **Confirm Logging Is Enabled:**  
  Ensure that your Trellix solution (e.g., Trellix Endpoint Detection and Response) is configured to generate detailed forensic logs (such as process events, network communications, file modifications, detections, etc.).

- **Plan Your Integration Method:**  
  Determine how Trellix forensic data will be available to Defender XDR. Options include:
  - Forwarding logs via Syslog to a SIEM or log collector that Defender XDR ingests.
  - Using a custom API connector to pull Trellix logs into Defender XDR.
  - Exporting forensic reports from Trellix regularly and ingesting them into Defender XDR dashboards.

## **Step 2. Configure Trellix Log Forwarding/Integration**

### 2.1 Set Up Log Forwarding from Trellix

- **Syslog or API-based Integration:**  
  Consult your Trellix administration guide to enable forwarding of forensic events. For example:  
  - **Syslog Integration:** Configure your Trellix console to send selected event types (e.g., malware detections, suspicious process launches, anomalous network communications) to a designated log collector that Defender XDR (or your SIEM feeding Defender XDR) references.
  - **API Export:** Alternatively, configure an automated export from Trellix at regular intervals (using available API endpoints) that outputs logs in JSON or CSV format. Then, use a script or custom connector to ingest this data into Defender XDR.

### 2.2 Verify Ingestion in Defender XDR

- **Custom Table or Source Identification:**  
  Once integrated, check for a dedicated data source or custom table (for example, *TrellixDetectionEvents* or a tagged field like `SourceSystem == "Trellix"`) within Defender XDR.
- **Run a Basic Query:**  
  In Advanced Hunting, run a simple query such as:
  ```kql
  // Look for events that originate from Trellix
  union isfuzzy=true DeviceProcessEvents, DeviceNetworkEvents
  | where SourceSystem == "Trellix" or AdditionalFields has "Trellix"
  | project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, ReportId
  | order by Timestamp desc
  ```
  Confirm that forensic events from Trellix are visible and that they carry expected markers or tags.

## **Step 3. Forensic Investigation with KQL in Defender XDR**

### 3.1 Investigate Suspicious Process or File Events

Create and run targeted queries that focus on specific threat indicators detected by Trellix.

#### **Example A: Suspicious Process Activity Identified by Trellix**
```kql
// Query to isolate suspicious processes flagged by Trellix
union isfuzzy=true DeviceProcessEvents, CustomTrellixEvents
| where (SourceSystem == "Trellix" or AdditionalFields has "Trellix")
      and FileName in ("malicious.exe", "suspicious.exe") // adjust filter per your IOC
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, ReportId, InitiatingProcessFileName
| order by Timestamp desc
```
- **Explanation:**  
  This query combines native process events with those tagged from Trellix and filters for known suspicious file names. Adjust the file names and criteria as needed.

#### **Example B: Correlate Network Communications with Forensic Alerts**
```kql
// Define a set of network events from Trellix and correlate with process events
let TrellixNetwork = 
    DeviceNetworkEvents
    | where SourceSystem == "Trellix" and RemoteUrl contains "malicious-domain.com";
let TrellixProcess = 
    DeviceProcessEvents
    | where SourceSystem == "Trellix" and ProcessCommandLine contains "Invoke-WebRequest";
TrellixNetwork
| join kind=inner TrellixProcess on DeviceName
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, RemoteUrl, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, ReportId
| order by Timestamp desc
```
- **Explanation:**  
  This query creates two subsets of events (network and process) filtered by Trellix markers and then joins them on the device name to correlate suspicious communication with suspicious process behavior.

### 3.2 Build a Forensic Timeline

For incident response, a timeline of activities is critical. Use the `bin()` operator to aggregate events by time intervals.
```kql
// Construct a timeline of suspicious Trellix events
union isfuzzy=true DeviceProcessEvents, DeviceNetworkEvents, CustomTrellixEvents
| where SourceSystem == "Trellix" or AdditionalFields has "Trellix"
| summarize EventsCount=count() by bin(Timestamp, 15m), DeviceName
| order by Timestamp asc
```
- **Explanation:**  
  This query aggregates all forensic events flagged from Trellix into 15-minute intervals. The result is an overview timeline showing when suspicious activity peaks.

---

## **Step 4. Incident Response and Documentation**

### 4.1 Identify and Mark Incidents
- **Flag Events:**  
  When a query returns events that look anomalous or correlate with known IOCs (indicators of compromise), note the `ReportId` and device names.
- **Mark for Investigation:**  
  Use Defender XDR’s clustering or incident creation features to flag these events for further analysis.

### 4.2 Document Findings
- **Export Query Results:**  
  Use the export functionality in Advanced Hunting to save the timeline or query results in CSV or JSON format for your incident response reports.
- **Build an Investigation Report:**  
  Document the sequence of events, correlation details, and any remediation actions taken. Include screenshots from Defender XDR, query definitions, and context from Trellix event details.

### 4.3 Remediate and Follow Up
- **Initiate Response Actions:**  
  Based on your forensic findings, initiate remediation actions (such as isolating devices or blocking IPs).  
- **Integrate with Workflows:**  
  Consider using Power Automate or built-in Defender XDR playbooks to trigger automated response activities when similar patterns are detected in the future.

---

## **Step 5. Continuous Improvement**

- **Refine KQL Queries:**  
  As new threat intelligence and forensic patterns emerge, update your queries with additional detectors and correlations.
- **Collaboration:**  
  Share successful queries and investigation methods with your security operations team and build a central repository of forensic queries.
- **Automation Opportunities:**  
  Evaluate further automation—such as scheduled queries that feed into SIEM dashboards or alert triggers—ensuring the team is notified promptly when suspicious activity is detected.
