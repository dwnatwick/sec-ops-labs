Below is a detailed, step-by-step lab for integrating Tenable logs with Microsoft Defender XDR. This lab assumes you’re working in a test environment where you have administrative credentials for both Microsoft Defender XDR and your Tenable instance (whether Tenable.io or Tenable.sc). Follow these steps to set up the integration, test log ingestion, and fine-tune your environment for actionable alerts.

## **Step 1. Prerequisites and Environment Preparation**

1. **Access and Permissions**  
   - **Microsoft Defender XDR:** Verify that your Defender XDR tenant is active and that you have full administrative privileges.  
   - **Tenable Instance:** Ensure your Tenable deployment is operational and that you have access to either Tenable.io or Tenable.sc.  
   - **API Credentials:** You’ll need API keys or tokens from Tenable to pull log and vulnerability data.  
   - **Optional – SIEM/Log Forwarder:** If you choose a two-step integration (first sending logs to a SIEM such as Microsoft Sentinel), ensure that agent/software is installed and configured.

2. **Gather Tools and Documentation**  
   - A tool like **Postman** or the command-line tool **cURL** to test API calls.  
   - A text editor to prepare configuration files and scripts.

## **Step 2. Configure Tenable for Log Export**

1. **Enable Logging in Tenable:**  
   - For **Tenable.io**:  
     - Log into your Tenable.io account.  
     - Navigate to **Settings > Integrations** (or **My Account > API Tokens**).  
     - Enable logging and generate an API token with read-only permissions focused on vulnerability scan data.
   - For **Tenable.sc**:  
     - Access the administrative settings.  
     - Configure vulnerability scans to produce logs and ensure that relevant logging options are activated.

2. **Generate an API Token:**  
   - Record your **Access Key / Secret Key** (Tenable.io) or equivalent credentials.  
   - Test the API connection:  
     - For example, using cURL:  
       ```bash
       curl -X GET "https://cloud.tenable.com/api/v3/scans" \
         -H "X-ApiKeys: accessKey=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY; secretKey=YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
       ```  
     - Inspect the returned JSON to ensure the API is returning the expected data.

## **Step 3. Set Up Log Forwarding/Connector**

You have two primary integration models:

### Option A: **Direct API Integration**
   1. **Use Defender XDR’s Custom Data Ingestion:**  
      - In Microsoft Defender XDR, navigate to the settings where custom connectors or data sources are configured.
      - Create a new connector and select the option for a custom API source.
      - Input the Tenable API endpoint (for example, the `/api/v3/scans` endpoint) along with the API token created earlier.
      - Define a polling schedule for Defender XDR to fetch updated logs (e.g., every 5 or 10 minutes).

### Option B: **Integration via SIEM (e.g., Microsoft Sentinel)**
   1. **Configure the SIEM to Collect Tenable Logs:**  
      - Install or enable the appropriate log forwarder or agent (e.g., a syslog agent or a cloud connector) on your Tenable server.
      - Point this agent to your SIEM platform’s ingestion endpoint.
   2. **Connect SIEM Data to Defender XDR:**  
      - In Defender XDR, set up a connector to ingest logs from your SIEM.
      - Use Kusto Query Language (KQL) or the Defender's built-in mapping interface to parse and forward the logs accurately.

## **Step 4. Configure Log Parsing and Field Mapping**

1. **Identify Key Fields in Tenable Logs:**  
   - Common fields might include:
     - **`timestamp`** (or scan time)
     - **`asset`** (hostname, IP address)
     - **`vulnerability_id`** (such as CVE numbers)
     - **`severity` / `risk_factor`**
     - **`plugin_name`** or scan source details

2. **Create Parsing Rules:**  
   - Within Defender XDR or your SIEM connector, define parsing rules to extract and map these fields.  
   - For example, you might define a JSON mapping:
     ```json
     {
       "timestamp": "$.scan_time",
       "asset": "$.hostname",
       "vulnerability_id": "$.cve",
       "severity": "$.risk_factor"
     }
     ```
   - Use regular expressions or built-in mapping functions as needed to handle variations in log formats.
  
3. **Test with Sample Logs:**  
   - Use a few sample log entries (exported manually from Tenable if needed) to verify that your mapping correctly identifies and converts the data.

## **Step 5. Integrate Tenable Logs into Microsoft Defender XDR**

1. **Deploy the Connector:**  
   - Activate your custom connector (or confirm the SIEM integration) to start pulling data from Tenable.
   - Monitor Defender XDR’s ingestion dashboard to verify that logs are arriving.  
2. **Log Collection Validation:**  
   - After deploying the connector, generate a vulnerability scan in Tenable.  
   - Check for unique records in Defender XDR that correspond to this scan.
  
3. **Troubleshooting Tips:**  
   - Verify network connectivity between Defender XDR and Tenable.
   - Recheck API credentials and endpoint URLs.
   - Consult log files or error dashboards for parsing failures.

## **Step 6. Create Detection Rules and Automated Responses**

1. **Set Up Custom Alerts:**  
   - In Defender XDR, create a detection rule to trigger an alert when a critical vulnerability is detected in the logs.  
   - For example, create a rule that fires when the `severity` field meets or exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., “High” or “Critical”).

2. **Define Response Actions:**  
   - Automate remediation workflows such as:
     - Creating tickets in your IT service management (ITSM) system.
     - Triggering additional scans or isolating affected endpoints.
   - Configure notifications (email or dashboard alerts) to ensure prompt investigation.

---

## **Step 7. Validate and Fine-Tune the Integration**

1. **End-to-End Testing:**  
   - Run a complete vulnerability scan on a test asset through Tenable.
   - Confirm that the logs corresponding to the scan are ingested, parsed, and trigger the custom detection rules in Defender XDR.
  
2. **Review and Iterate:**  
   - Fine-tune parsing rules and thresholds based on the test results.
   - Check the performance and accuracy of automated responses.
   - Document any deviations and update your configuration and internal documentation for future troubleshooting.

3. **Monitor and Log:**  
   - Regularly review dashboards and logs in Defender XDR to ensure continuous integration.
   - Schedule periodic tests (e.g., monthly vulnerability scans) to confirm that the integration remains robust as both Tenable and Defender XDR are updated.

## **Additional Tips and Next Steps**

- **Security and Access:** Regularly review API tokens and access permissions. Rotate credentials periodically to maintain security best practices.
- **Expand Data Sources:** Once the integration is stable, consider adding other vulnerability or threat feeds into Defender XDR for a more comprehensive view of your security posture.
- **Training and Documentation:** Develop or update training materials for your security operations team to understand how to monitor, respond to, and troubleshoot alerts related to vulnerability data from Tenable.

By following this lab, you’ll have a robust integration that brings together Tenable’s vulnerability scanning data with Microsoft Defender XDR’s powerful threat detection and response capabilities.
