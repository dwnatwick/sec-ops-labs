Below is a comprehensive, step‐by‐step guide for performing Defender EDR and detailed endpoint analysis using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. This guide is designed to help your security team—from initial configuration and data collection to advanced hunting, forensic investigation, and automated remediation—build confidence in your endpoint security posture.

## **Step 1: Preparation and Environment Setup**

1. **Verify Licensing and Permissions**  
   - Confirm that your organization’s subscription includes Defender for Endpoint EDR capabilities.  
   - Ensure that the appropriate role-based access control (RBAC) assignments (such as Security Reader, Security Operator, or Security Administrator) are in place so you can access and manage EDR telemetry and alerts.

2. **Deploy and Onboard Endpoints**  
   - Use Microsoft Endpoint Manager (Intune, Configuration Manager, or Group Policy) to deploy the Defender for Endpoint sensor to the target endpoints.  
   - Validate onboarding by checking that each device appears in the Defender portal and that telemetry is flowing appropriately.  
   - Optionally, run the Defender Client Analyzer tool to ensure connectivity between endpoints and cloud services.

3. **Establish a Baseline**  
   - Collect and review normal endpoint behavior data (process executions, network connections, logged events) to define what “normal” looks like.  
   - This baseline is crucial for later identifying anomalies during incident analysis.

## **Step 2: Configure Defender for Endpoint EDR**

1. **Enable EDR Features and Policies**  
   - In the Microsoft Defender Security Center, verify that EDR is set to “investigate” or “block” mode as appropriate for your organization.  
   - Configure automated investigation and remediation (AIR) settings to help reduce response times for detected anomalies.

2. **Set Up Data Ingestion and Integration**  
   - Ensure that all relevant data sources—endpoint process events, file events, network events, and security alerts—feed into Defender for Endpoint.  
   - Integrate with SIEM solutions like Microsoft Sentinel if you need extended correlation and analysis capabilities.

## **Step 3: Data Collection and Initial Assessment**

1. **Monitor the Incident Queue and Dashboards**  
   - Regularly review the Incidents queue in the Defender portal. These incidents are generated once suspicious behaviors or indicators of attack (IOAs) are detected.  
   - Use the Dashboard to see the overall security posture and any emerging trends.

2. **Confirm Telemetry Collection**  
   - Validate that endpoint logs, file changes, network anomalies, and process events are being recorded.  
   - Use in-built client diagnostics or auditing tools to ensure no gaps in your log collection.

## **Step 4: Performing Initial Forensic Analysis**

1. **Review Alert Details**  
   - Click on individual alerts for more context. Examine the timeline of events, including process creation, network connections, and file modifications.  
   - Look for anomalies such as unusual parent-child process relationships or unexpected outbound connections.

2. **Utilize Timeline Views and Contextual Data**  
   - Leverage Defender’s timeline and drill-down capabilities to trace the progression of events that led to an alert.  
   - Cross-reference events with available threat intelligence (e.g., IOC matches) for additional context.

## **Step 5: Advanced Hunting with Kusto Query Language (KQL)**

1. **Formulate Advanced Queries**  
   - Begin by filtering on a specific time window using KQL. For example:  
     ```kusto
     DeviceEvents
     | where Timestamp > ago(7d)
     ```  
   - Adjust the query to target suspicious behaviors such as unexpected PowerShell activity:  
     ```kusto
     DeviceProcessEvents
     | where FileName in~ ("powershell.exe", "pwsh.exe")
     | where InitiatingProcessCommandLine has "Invoke-" 
     | project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, FileName
     ```

2. **Combine Data Sources**  
   - Use `union` or `join` operators to correlate events from multiple tables (process and network events) to create a holistic view:  
     ```kusto
     union DeviceProcessEvents, DeviceNetworkEvents
     | where Timestamp > ago(7d)
     | where FileName in~ ("powershell.exe", "pwsh.exe")
     | project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, RemoteIP
     | top 50 by Timestamp
     ```

3. **Integrate Threat Intelligence**  
   - Include threat intelligence data by joining with dedicated threat tables to flag known malicious IPs, domains, or file hashes.  
   - For example:  
     ```kusto
     let ThreatIPs = 
       ThreatIntelligenceIndicator
       | where ThreatType == "IP" and ConfidenceScore > 70
       | project Indicator;
     DeviceNetworkEvents
     | where Timestamp > ago(7d)
     | where RemoteIP in (ThreatIPs)
     | project Timestamp, DeviceName, RemoteIP, ActionType
     ```  
   These queries empower your threat hunters to pinpoint events that merit additional scrutiny.

## **Step 6: Deep-Dive Endpoint Analysis**

1. **Forensic Data Collection**  
   - Gather detailed process trees, module load information, and file system changes from the endpoint logs.  
   - Look for artifacts such as unusual registry modifications, persistence mechanisms, or uncommon scheduled tasks.

2. **Timeline and Event Correlation**  
   - Use the Defender portal’s timeline view to correlate events in a chronological sequence to understand the attacker’s progression.  
   - Establish relationships between seemingly isolated events—for example, a known benign process suddenly spawning child processes with suspicious command-line arguments.

3. **Manual Verification**  
   - If an endpoint appears compromised, consider further manual analysis. This may involve examining memory dumps, registry snapshots, or using additional forensic tools to verify the findings.

## **Step 7: Automated Investigation, Remediation, and Response**

1. **Trigger Automated Investigations**  
   - For incidents that meet predefined criteria, use Defender’s automated investigation capabilities to run preconfigured remediation actions.  
   - Validate and adjust automated playbooks if needed to refine response over time.

2. **Isolate and Contain Threats**  
   - Based on the severity of detected incidents, isolate affected endpoints to prevent lateral movement across the network.  
   - Use integrated response actions within Defender to block malicious processes or network connections.

3. **Document Findings and Actions**  
   - Maintain detailed incident reports documenting the timeline, indicators, and remediation efforts.  
   - This documentation is not only essential for compliance but also for improving future detection techniques.

## **Step 8: Continuous Improvement and Post-Incident Analysis**

1. **Review and Update Hunting Queries**  
   - Regularly refine KQL queries based on observed false positives or missed detections.  
   - Leverage the MITRE ATT&CK framework to map new adversary tactics and update your detection rules accordingly.

2. **Engage in Post-Incident Reviews**  
   - Conduct after-action reviews with your SOC team to discuss what worked well during the investigation and what could be improved.  
   - Document lessons learned and update your incident response playbooks.

3. **Integrate External Threat Intelligence Feeds**  
   - Continuously enrich your telemetry by integrating additional threat intelligence sources.  
   - This can help calibrate detection thresholds, quickly identify new adversary techniques, and adjust response measures accordingly.

## **Conclusion**

This step-by-step guide outlines a structured process—from setting up and onboarding endpoints with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint EDR to performing detailed forensic investigations using advanced hunting queries and integrating threat intelligence. By systematically preparing your environment, collecting and correlating data, and leveraging both manual and automated response mechanisms, you can develop a proactive and efficient approach to endpoint security analysis.
